# Natally architecture

## Operator corrections: application identity and superseded build hold — 28 October 2026

The operator selected `mba.robin.natally` as the production application ID and
requires application configuration, including the application name, to originate
in `.env`. For this installation the name is `Natally`. These replace the legacy
`online.rebots.natally.aistudio.test` identity; historical evidence is retained.
The operator's earlier build hold is historical and was superseded by the later
explicit instruction to "build now in parallel". The prescribed coordinator
subsequently completed v1.12.86707 with all twelve outputs verified and exit 0;
the failed 1.11.86659 invocation remains preserved historical evidence.
Android sign-in is a functional repair,
not only a branding change: the current desktop-only native branch leaves
Android on WebView popup/reCAPTCHA flows and requires actual device verification.

### Configuration contract and enumerated entities

The following bounded identity change implements the operator's explicit choice.
It does not authorize new authentication providers, wallets or hosting.

| Entity / location | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| `.env`: `APP_NAME`, `APP_IDENTIFIER` | Sole editable application-identity values; this installation uses `Natally` and `mba.robin.natally`. Both must be deliberately set. No default product name or package ID. |
| `.env.example` | Document both required keys with empty values and an instruction to configure the fork's own identity. Empty examples are configuration input, never rendered product placeholders. |
| `scripts/app-identity.mjs`: `loadAppIdentity`, `syncNativeIdentity` | Read `.env` using Node's `parseEnv`; validate a nonempty application name and reverse-domain package identifier; reject missing/example/test release identifiers. Project all native metadata from the same pair without changing version or signing. Paths remain within the repository. |
| `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` | Derived `productName`, `identifier`, window-title name and bundle short description; preserve coordinator-produced version and unrelated settings. |
| Android `build.gradle.kts`, `strings.xml`, Kotlin package declarations and ProGuard qualified class names | Derived namespace/applicationId/name/title and package references. Move the existing package subtree to the configured reverse-domain path, preserving its code, introduction artwork and behavior. Apply the same package transformation to buildSrc references if present; no stale old-package JNI/ProGuard references. |
| `scripts/configure-android.mjs` | Invoke identity projection during existing coordinator preparation. Idempotent preparation must not overwrite deliberate identity with the legacy test ID. |
| `scripts/release-state.mjs`: `stamp` | Use configured application name when deriving the versioned window title. Validate required identity before consuming a new version; do not execute stamp during the build hold. |
| `vite.config.ts`: `__APP_IDENTITY__` | Expose only the validated public name and identifier, never the remainder of `.env`. Read the same identity in dev and coordinated builds. |
| `src/services/appIdentity.ts`: `APP_NAME`, `APP_IDENTIFIER` | Public projection consumed by application title/branding labels; no hardcoded fallback. Established fictional character name/content is distinct from the application's configurable identity. |
| HTML entry titles, PWA name/short_name, application-name and window labels | Consume this projection. A fork must not inherit Natally's application identity through an independent default. Preserve the authored design and actual content. |

```mermaid

  ENV[.env: APP_NAME and APP_IDENTIFIER] --> READ[loadAppIdentity: required values]
  READ --> NATIVE[syncNativeIdentity]
  NATIVE --> TAURI[Tauri product name, ID and window title]
  NATIVE --> ANDROID[Android namespace, applicationId, package declarations and labels]
  READ --> WEB[Vite public identity projection]
  WEB --> LABELS[Application labels, document titles and PWA identity]
  READ --> STAMP[Existing coordinator stamp uses configured name]
  HOLD[Historical build hold - superseded by explicit build instruction] -. previously prevented invocation .-> STAMP
```

Acceptance before the next authorized build: inspect every identity consumer and
confirm it derives from `.env`; exercise the configuration projection twice with
unchanged values and show identical output; confirm missing identity fails before
stamping; preserve all nonidentity source bytes during package relocation. Native
installation, Google/Firebase package and certificate binding, billing restore
and updated-app behavior require separate runtime evidence. Renaming a package
does not migrate an installed app or establish a Play listing automatically.

Precipitating failure: an internal test identifier was allowed to become a
candidate public package identity and was offered when the operator needed to
create the Play listing. The correction is structural: required explicit identity
inputs, one projection into all outputs, and no release fallback to placeholder
or another publisher's identity. Checking only visible APK filenames missed the
embedded application ID; acceptance must inspect embedded metadata as well.

## Paid customer journey repair — 28 October 2026

Operator-reported release v1.10.86133 accepted a real payment, then displayed
disconnected purchasing and zero ROCHE. The live RevenueCat customer read confirms
one production Exploration credits purchase with status owned. Its wallet contains
10 NATALTURN; the required currency remains literal ROCHE. No paid fulfillment or
successful inference is established by that purchase record. Repair the existing
commercial contract rather than replacing it with another currency or ledger.

The operator requires a portable customer-experience audit skill whose primary
method reasons as if rendered from actual design HTML, source, states and visible
content. Customer misunderstandings, lost effort, false expectations and reasons
to abandon are defects even when handlers pass. Cold-context interpretation and
targeted device/provider observation supplement that reasoning. The installed
ux-journey-audit skill and its portable package implement this review method.

Required customer outcomes and repair ownership:

| Entity or surface | Required behavior | Engaged by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PurchaseAccessProvider.startPurchase` / `restore` | Preserve known payment confirmation; reconcile and install actual purchased access; return to the requested Natally experience when ready; delayed access must not reopen purchase or deny payment | UX-PAY-1 |
| `requestBillingAccess` / existing provisioning adapter | Same authenticated customer; current shared ROCHE; adopted one-hour key routine; no false zero or placeholder configuration state | UX-PAY-1 |
| `InferenceAccessSettings` | Authoritative balance and usable account recovery; actual purchase action; no static disconnected payment-method cards contradicting live checkout | UX-PAY-1 |
| RevenueCat product grants and customer record | Correct literal ROCHE grant and recovery of already-owned purchase; preserve unrelated grants and existing ownership; do not invent conversion values | UX-PAY-2 |
| Provider product name, merchant settings, receipts | Customer names Souvenir reading / Exploration credits; approved robin.mba and rochemediaservices.com domains; no expired robinsai.world customer-facing identity | UX-PAY-2 |
| Android purchase adapter | Actual native Google Play billing through RevenueCat, same Firebase UID; correct offerings, purchase, restore, confirmation and shared ROCHE; Play is primary Android payment, not a hosted-card substitute | UX-PLAY-1 |
| Approved exported offer HTML | Preserve authored design and selected offer while wiring real actions and state; do not replace with a coder-designed screen | UX-UI-1 |
| Android activity, checkout viewport, city autocomplete | Focused field and typed value remain reachable with IME; usable search/results ordering; keyboard cannot trap typing; recovery preserves input | UX-UI-1 |
| `Build-Android` / release manifest and download surfaces | Public APK/AAB filenames omit internal test labels; embedded version comes only from prescribed coordinator; internal identifiers/certificates retain actual meaning | UX-ARTIFACT-1 |

UX-ARTIFACT-1 is a bounded immediate source correction: in
`scripts/build-all-platforms.ps1`, `Build-Android` passes
`android-arm64.apk` and `android-arm64.aab` to `Stage`, preserving all signature,
alignment, version and symbol checks. `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` describes the product
as `Natally personal astrology and exploration`, not a test shell. Package IDs
and signing identity are not display names and must not be renamed blindly.
Check downstream consumers for exact old suffix dependencies and update only
actual filename consumers. Do not alter historical evidence to erase the incident.

All repairs require distinct analytical, source, rendered/native, provider and
artifact evidence. No successful all-platform build can certify unfulfilled paid
access or native Play purchasing. The final requested build runs through
`scripts/build-all-platforms.ps1` after source repairs, with per-target outcomes.
Existing uncommitted work belongs to its current task and must be preserved.

### UX-UI-1 input and checkout geometry contract

`locations.ts` exposes `rankCityMatches(query, candidates, limit=10)` using a
trimmed, case-folded query across name/adminRegion/country. Rank exact name,
name prefix, then contained text; sort each rank by locale-aware name, region,
country and coordinates for deterministic ties, deduplicate coordinates/name,
and cap output. Empty queries return at most eight alphabetically ordered local
suggestions and never trigger online search. `searchPlaceOnline` uses that same
ranking after merging results; a no-match query immediately clears old options.

The birthplace/current-residence inputs in `NatalInputForm` and transit/partner
inputs in `ReadingsModal` each have independent query-generation refs. Increment
on input, selection, reset, unmount and account/session change. Async results and
finally/loading updates apply only to the captured generation. Debounce alone
is insufficient. During IME composition do not select on Enter. Preserve selected
coordinates/timezones and all existing customer data contracts.

Results remain in normal document flow directly below the associated input,
inside the existing scrollable form, with a scrollable list bounded by the current
visual viewport. Existing colours, typography and button content remain intact.
Use real combobox/listbox semantics, stable option IDs, active descendant,
Up/Down/Enter/Escape handling and visible loading/no-match feedback. Input remains
focused while choosing through keyboard; touch selection still works. No giant
overlay or magic top offset may cover the focused field. `ReadingsModal` panel
uses current visual viewport bounds with scrollable content and reachable close.

Web checkout gets an owned `HTMLElement` passed as `htmlTarget` to the existing
RevenueCat SDK. `PurchaseAccess` creates the mount before starting the purchase,
sizes it to `visualViewport` top/left/width/height with safe-area padding, and
updates bounds on viewport changes. The SDK owns fields, validation and purchase
state inside it. Do not edit vendor code or hashed CSS selectors. Keep the mount
alive until the purchase settles, then remove it and restore focus. Preserve
provider cancellation; closing or resizing must not fabricate a cancelled charge.
Native Android uses real IME/system-bar insets and `adjustResize`; verify in the
actual target before claiming the reported keyboard defect resolved.

### UX-PLAY-1 platform commerce contract

Retain the exported Figma HTML and existing offering selectors. Android uses an
app-local Tauri `natally-billing` plugin registered with the existing package and
`NatallyBillingPlugin` class; other targets keep Web Billing. Native SDK is pinned
to `com.revenuecat.purchases:purchases:11.0.0`, Kotlin plugin to 2.2.21, existing
compileSdk 36 and toolchain unchanged. Current Tauri 2.12.4 supports
`register_android_plugin` and `run_mobile_plugin_async` for this bridge. Preserve
intro animation and desktop authentication. Purchase activity launchMode becomes
`singleTop`, with explicit IME resize/inset handling. Public native API key and
actual Play product IDs are configuration bindings, never invented constants.

`nativeRevenueCat.ts` wraps native commands and selects Android by a native
platform command, not user-agent inference. Native `configureOwner`, `quote`,
`purchase`, `customer`, `restore`, `balance` and `logout` accept UID and session
generation; responses echo both. Serialize SDK ownership operations. Configure
once with actual goog_ key and Firebase UID, then await logIn on owner change.
Validate current owner/generation before and after each callback; clear quotes
on identity change. Quotes retain the native Package under an opaque ID, owner,
generation and two-minute expiry; purchase consumes it once and forbids overlap.
Only actual native callbacks yield purchased/cancelled/pending outcomes.
PaymentPendingError preserves recovery and does not invite another purchase.

Customer projection contains owner and active entitlement IDs, not a cast of a
native object to the Web SDK type. Passive access reads use
getCustomerInfo(FETCH_CURRENT); explicit Restore alone uses restorePurchases.
ROCHE reads invalidate the native currency cache and return literal ROCHE's actual
balance; missing response remains unknown. Neither plugin nor client grants
credits or maintains a commercial balance. Successful purchases run the same
authoritative session-provisioning routine before returning to Natally.

Required live bindings remain: verified existing Play app/package, actual goog_
public SDK key and native product IDs, offering/entitlement/ROCHE product grants,
configured ROCHE conversion, and store-distributed signed release. A missing
binding is an explicit release prerequisite; never present placeholder payment
capability or silently route a promised native Play purchase to web checkout.

Named bridge DTOs, passive caller preservation, environment bindings and pinned
SDK evidence: [UX-PLAY-1 native bindings](ARCHITECTURE/2026-10-28-native-play-bindings.md).

## Identity and authority

This replacement is based on the implemented source graph at commit
`f3470d4ffec6438582e643f6f2e7e542513676d1`, captured for the operator-requested
28 October 2026 04:50:31 UTC audit. The inventory below remains anchored to that snapshot. Later source additions
and the adopted session-key contract are described separately below. No old architecture narrative
is incorporated. The exact previous document is preserved as
[ARCHITECTURE-before-codegraph-replacement-28oct2026-00h57.md](ARCHITECTURE-before-codegraph-replacement-28oct2026-00h57.md).

RevenueCat authority is the longstanding explicit specification, not an open
architectural decision: customer/account commercial records, purchases,
entitlements and shared ROCHE belong to RevenueCat. Firebase provides identity
and operational data linked to that customer. Every session validates its associated OpenRouter key, reuses a valid
one-hour-limited key or issues one, sets its spending limit from current shared
ROCHE, and saves the association. Zero ROCHE and logout/teardown deactivate the
key. See [the adopted session-key architecture](SESSION-KEY-ARCHITECTURE.md) for
flows, ownership, exceptions and acceptance scenes. Implementation is incomplete.
Old documentation contradicting RevenueCat is erroneous
and must not be interpreted as an alternative to this requirement.

This file distinguishes implemented structure from unfinished required behavior.
It does not redefine success as the current code. No architectural proposals are
in process; development proceeds against the already agreed specification, with
rubric demonstration before entertaining changes.

## Canonical build major selection — corrective implementation

The operator rejected all major-zero artifacts. `npm run build:all -- -Major 1`
selects the minimum compliant major through the existing matrix coordinator.
The optional `Major` argument is an integer from 1 through 255 (shared MSI bound).
It is forbidden with `-Continue`; continuing retains the original frozen stamp.
`nextStamp(previous, now, requestedMajor)` validates the explicit major, rejects
major rollback, preserves the existing minor counter and increments it once.
Without that argument, the previous major remains authoritative and zero is rejected.
The coordinator passes the choice to `stamp`; only `stamp` writes the synchronized
version metadata. No separate platform command or manual metadata edit is added.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  CALL[build:all optional Major] --> CHECK{Continue?}
  CHECK -->|yes: no Major allowed| RETAIN[Verify frozen stamp and retained artifacts]
  CHECK -->|no| STAMP[Validate major selection; increment minor once]
  STAMP --> WRITE[Write identical platform version metadata]
  WRITE --> FREEZE[Freeze complete source inputs]
  FREEZE --> MATRIX[Build entire existing platform matrix]
```

## Shared session orchestration binding

`billing/customer-session.mjs` binds the existing RevenueCat customer helpers and
OpenRouter key helper. `syncCustomerSessionKey(uid, options)` receives explicit
`revenueCat`, `openRouter`, `limitFromRoche` and `withCustomerOperation` options.
The two callbacks are required: no invented currency conversion and no pretend
cross-instance locking. The established authenticated adapter must supply its
customer-operation serialization/recovery boundary; this module creates no host,
database, ledger or callback service.

Within that boundary: read the customer; only a confirmed 404 permits create;
read the key association; call reconcileManagedKey; its allowance callback reads
current ROCHE after key validity/issuance and applies limitFromRoche; save and
verify the association; then return ready/unfunded with the actual ROCHE snapshot,
computed limit and provider result. A zero ROCHE balance must yield a zero limit.
Non-finite/negative limits and a nonzero balance converted to zero are configuration
errors. Provider/read/write failures propagate without reporting success. Pending
issuance/write recovery remains the caller boundary's responsibility, as already
required by the session exception contract. This helper alone is not deployment.

`deactivateCustomerSessionKey(uid, expectedHash, options)` runs through the same
boundary, reads the association and disables only the matching current key. A
missing or superseded association returns deactivated=false; it never deletes
ROCHE or replaces an association. This prevents a delayed old-session logout from
revoking a newly associated key.

| Symbol | Engaged by | Role |
|---|---|---|
| syncCustomerSessionKey | SK-BIND | Common creation/returning-session orchestration |
| deactivateCustomerSessionKey | SK-BIND | Logout deactivation of matching association |
| limitFromRoche | SK-BIND caller | Existing commercial conversion supplied explicitly |
| withCustomerOperation | SK-BIND caller | Existing per-customer serialization/recovery supplied explicitly |

## MA — interactive marketing atelier

IN_PROGRESS. Architecture and complete continuous demonstration:
[MARKETING-ATELIER.md](MARKETING-ATELIER.md). Reuse existing AtelierScene and
Astrolabe3D in the approved marketing slots. Authored local speech only; no paid
reading/conversation path. Requirements MA01–MA07 map to MT01–MT07 and MS01–MS07.
